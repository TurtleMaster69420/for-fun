WARNING: Do not run "file_rearrangement [VOLATILE].py" in your local directory, run it in a separate testing directory. It causes more complex file types, such as pdf's and word documents, to become corrupted.

NOTE: chrome_password_stealer will only print the passwords onto the screen, not send them to any server (you can read the code :P). The pyinstaller-compiled executable is `lmao.exe` and the DuckyScript code for a *hypothetical* rubber ducky execution is `duckycode.txt`. This is purely for educational purposes to highlight that Windows probably shouldn't be allowing anyone to make calls to their CryptUnprotect API (it's not Chrome's fault btw).

Unhelpful programs for absolutely none of your needs.
